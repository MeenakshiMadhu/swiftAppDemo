# Swift Learning Journey

Hi there! 

I'm currently learning **Swift** and exploring some basic tutorials to get familiar with the language and development in **Xcode**.

Iâ€™m really enjoying [CodeWithChris on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithChris). His tutorials are straightforward and do a great job of covering the fundamentals needed to get started with Swift and iOS app development.

Stay tuned as I add more of my learning projects here!
